# Sentiment analysis on health domain: analyzing patient comments on drugs.

## Abstract

Most of the research in sentiment analysis has been conducted in general domains such as the analysis of film reviews, restaurants and other products or services, but without much representation in the medical field. Increasingly, patients are searching the internet for information about the potential benefits, adverse effects and opinions that other patients have about different drugs. The aim of this work is to predict the degree of patient satisfaction with a given drug based on their reviews. To carry out the task, we have used a collection of reviews on different types of drugs and applied a convolutional network for their classification. The results show that this type of network provides better results in terms of precision, recall and f1-score than using classical classification algorithms such as vector support machines.
